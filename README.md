# Coursework Description - The Task

A local council has collected a number of datasets detailing traffic flow at road junctions in the area. The data, collected for two junctions (Elm Avenue/Rabbit Road and Hanley Highway/Westway) over a number of days has been tabulated and saved as .CSV files (two are supplied â€“ each one for a particular 24-hour period).

You have been tasked with writing a program which analyses the data and returns data to allow the council to make informed decisions to manage traffic flow. Your program should allow council staff to select any particular  CSV dataset file (by date), analyse the data and summarise the specific elements required.
It should also save the results as a text file (Task C) and display the results of some specific analysis in graphical form (Task D: Histogram).

The data structure of the csv files is shown below with each row representing the recording of one vehicle passing through one of the two junctions at a specific time on the selected date (below are two rows as an example, see the CSV files for full data list).
